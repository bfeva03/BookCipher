# BookCipher iOS (Xcode Skeleton)

This folder contains a starter Xcode-style project layout for a native iOS app
version of BookCipher. It includes SwiftUI views, OCR scaffolding, and crypto
stubs that mirror the Python pipeline.

Open `BookCipheriOS.xcodeproj` in Xcode to begin wiring up the app target,
entitlements, and build settings.
